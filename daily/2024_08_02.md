* second day
* I'm taking some inspiration from Cristian, and log some of my community work
    * source: https://github.com/cmaureir/community-work
    * today's community work?
        * more reconciliation of EP finances, and paying out last few invoices
        * start processing the payments for finaid and organiser refunds

* on a separate note, I'm using wise.com lately, to process some of the EP payments
* while using it I noticed a few interesting things
    * for example that account balance before nor after the transaction is not mentioned anywhere in UI nor the CSV export
    * this means it's harder to figure out, among other things, if the fee (that is reported) is included in the quoted echange rate or not
